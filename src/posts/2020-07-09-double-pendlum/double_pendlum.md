## Description

Chaotic system is exteremely sensitive to initial conditions. A chaotic system is not actually random, if we give enough time to system we can actually predict the deterministic behaviour of the system. Given enough time, two identical setups, set to initial conditions that are as identical as possible, will look entirely different.<br></br>
